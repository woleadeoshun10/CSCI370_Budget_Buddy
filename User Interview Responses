User Interview Responses 
Respondent 1
This person works a salaried job and admits they don’t really understand budgeting yet. They’ve been thinking about trying Excel but haven’t started. What they really want are simple savings tools and reminders that keep them on track. They liked every motivational idea we showed them — seeing work hours, delaying goals, achievements, streaks — all rated a perfect 5/5. They also admitted they’re pretty impulsive and usually make between 1–10 purchases each month that they regret afterward.

Respondent 2
This user is an hourly worker who knows a lot about personal finance but still doesn’t keep a budget. They prefer a straightforward spending limit and want clear breakdowns of where their money goes. They don’t consider themselves impulsive. What motivates them most is seeing how much they spend unnecessarily each month, especially if they can quickly categorize purchases with a swipe. They rated all our motivation features around 4/5 — helpful, but not game-changing.

Respondent 3
A student earning about $25/hour who feels they only know the basics about money. They already use Budget Buddy to track spending and want the app to feel smooth and easy to navigate. They see budgeting as understanding what they can afford and how their money is divided up. They admit to being somewhat impulsive with 1–10 regrettable purchases monthly. Most of our features, especially direct nudges and reminders, seem very effective for them.

Respondent 4
Another student with hourly income who budgets the old-fashioned way — on paper or on an iPad once a week. They want tools to warn them before they overdraft and to help them stay aligned with their future financial goals. They sometimes buy things they regret (1–10 per month). They loved the work-hours translation (5/5) but didn’t find “goal delay” as motivating as other users (3/5).

Respondent 5
This participant is a salaried student who knows a lot about money but doesn’t actually budget. They mostly rely on their bank app. What they really want is a separate budget account to help them stop impulsive buying, because for them budgeting is mostly about saving money. Even though they say they aren’t impulsive, they still fall into the 1–10 regrettable purchases range. Achievement badges, reminders, and streak progress were the features they liked best.

Respondent 6
A salaried worker with limited financial knowledge who uses the Every Dollar app every two weeks. They sometimes make regrettable purchases (1–10 per month). The features that work best for them are goal delays and achievements — both rated 5/5 — while work-hours translation and streaks were slightly less impactful but still strong motivators.

Respondent 7
A student with hourly income who feels confident about how they spend money, even though they don’t actually budget. They want educational videos and tools that help them decide where their money should go. They describe themselves as impulsive and typically regret 1–10 purchases each month. They said that seeing work hours would be very motivating (5/5), and the other features also seemed helpful (rated 4–5).


Respondent 8
This hourly worker has some financial knowledge and wants an app that keeps track of everything—savings, subscriptions, credit score, bills, and even goal allocations using percentages. They don’t consider themselves impulsive at all (0 regrettable purchases). What motivates them most is a daily spending limit feature that locks or restricts spending. They rated almost all motivational features as very effective (5/5), except streaks, which they didn’t connect with at all (1/5).

Respondent 9
A student with hourly income who already budgets using Excel but wants something simpler and easier than spreadsheets. They aren’t impulsive (0 regrettable purchases) and mainly want better visuals that show how much money they have left to invest. They really liked the work-hours translation and achievement features (both 5/5), but streaks didn’t work for them (1/5).

Respondent 10
This user is currently unemployed but understands finances fairly well. They want something very different: an AI-powered app that actively prevents bad financial decisions. They want real-time purchase blocking, restrictions they can set, and a conversational system that remembers things. They aren’t impulsive and don’t regret purchases, so most motivational features scored low for them — except goal delays (3/5). What matters most is a smart, easy-to-use AI that helps them avoid bad decisions before they make them.

Respondent 11
An hourly worker who is extremely disciplined — they track every dollar using Google Sheets and only “budget” the fun stuff. They never make regrettable purchases. They want features like detailed expense categorization, future financial planning tools, a wishlist with savings timelines, and reminders that suggest cheaper alternatives. Achievements motivate them the most (5/5), work-hours translation was somewhat helpful (4/5), but goal delays (2/5) and streaks (1/5) didn’t resonate as much.

Respondent 12
A student earning $16.50/hour who understands most financial topics except taxes and stocks. They save about 70% of every paycheck and mainly track spending using their Apple Card balance. Because they live with their parents, they don’t have many expenses, but they admit that sales can make them impulsive (1–10 regrettable purchases). They said they’d respond well to a feature that asks, “Do you really need this?” or makes them justify a purchase. Their effectiveness ratings ranged from moderate to good (2–4).

Respondent 13
A student with strong financial habits who uses their banking apps to self-manage everything. They maintain minimums in checking and invest the rest. They’d like the app to recommend investments, suggest a monthly food budget, and help them plan occasional self-reward purchases. They’re not impulsive at all (0 regrettable purchases). They were motivated by long-term goals and rated all features somewhere between moderate and highly effective (4–5). They believe this app would especially help younger and college students.

Respondent 14
A student with no income who doesn’t currently budget but likes how the Chase app categorizes spending. They consider themselves impulsive (1–10 regrettable purchases). They want simple budgeting features, purchase categorization, and warnings when they’re buying unnecessary things. They said they’d respond most to friend involvement or seeing negative product reviews. Achievements and goal delays stood out as very effective (5/5), while streaks were helpful but not as strong (3/5).
